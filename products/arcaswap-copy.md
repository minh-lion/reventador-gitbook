# ArcaSwap (copy)

The Arca DEX currently charges a protocol fee of 0.01% for swaps that is distributed to all liquidity providers. Some of our pools will allow flash-loaning assets for a small fee.



## Decentralized Exchange

As an automated market-making (AMM), facilitating decentralized exchanges or swaps of various coin pairs is the core of what we do!

Users can trade coins in the Moonbeam network in a non-custodial manner without going through any centralized intermediary and paying excessive fees. With StellaSwap, the small trading fees that are charged will be fully distributed to liquidity providers. This ensures that liquidity providers are incentivized to provide the depth of liquidity needed to give you the best prices across the board.

## Providing Liquidity

Providing liquidity on Arca will not only net you the transactions fee from users trading in any given pool, but also to any ARCA token incentives allocated to that pool. Please keep in mind that these aspects below here:

* **You may deposit or withdraw any combination of tokens you'd like.** This means that in a pool of 4 tokens, you can deposit all 4 in equal amounts, or just 1 at any time.
* **Depositing or withdrawing a token that helps balance the pool gives you a discount.** The opposite is true for transactions that further imbalance the pool.
