IRON aims to be money with a stable, consistent, and predictable value that provides exposure to all crypto backing it. It is decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed, and hard-pegged to the decentralized USD.

## Mission

The mission of the IRON Stablecoin is to perform the functions of money:

1. A store of value
2. A medium of exchange
3. A unit of account
4. A standard of deferred payment

### IRON as a Store of Value

A store of value is an asset, commodity, or currency that maintains its value without depreciating. Because IRON is a stablecoin, it is designed to function as a store of value, even in volatile markets.

### IRON as a Medium of Exchange

A medium of exchange is an intermediary instrument or system used to facilitate the sale, purchase, or trade of goods between parties. IRON aims to be the medium of exchange in the decentralized, non-custodial ecosystem of[ DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) products, protocols, and use cases that make up Iron Finance.

### IRON as a Unit of Account

A unit of account is measurement for value, used to assign value to goods and services. IRON currently has a target price of 1 USD. While IRON is not used as a standard measure of value [off-chain](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meatspace), IRON functions as a unit of account within the Iron Finance protocol and some blockchain dapps.

### IRON as a Standard of Deferred Payment on IronLend
