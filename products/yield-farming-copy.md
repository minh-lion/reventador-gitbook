# Yield Farming (copy)

Users can earn returns passively by making their coins "work for them". StellaSwap provides a variety of features that allow users to yield farm and enhance their returns.

### What is Yield Farming?

Yield farming refers to the practice of staking or lending crypto assets in order to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. On a high-level, it means putting your coins to work. This innovative yet risky and volatile application of decentralized finance (DeFi) has skyrocketed in popularity recently thanks to further innovations like liquidity mining.

StellaSwap incentivizes _yield farmers_ or anyone who wants to generate yield by rewarding those that stake their coins into our liquidity pools and vaults. This effort entails adding liquidity to StellaSwap's network, and then staking liquidity provider tokens. Projects incentivize this behavior when it enables them to function more efficiently.

### How Can I Yield Farm on StellaSwap ?

Users can expect the following yields on StellaSwap by providing liquidity (LP) or by locking their $STELLA in Booster vaults;

1. **Swap Fee Profit-Sharing:** Whenever a trade is made on StellaSwap, 0.25% of the swap fees are distributed to liquidity providers (through our **Farms**) and 0.05% of swap fees are distributed to those who lock their $STELLA on **Booster Vaults**.
2. **Network Token Reward:** On top of the profit-sharing of swap fees, liquidity providers and lockers of $STELLA will also get additional rewards in the form of $STELLA native tokens.
