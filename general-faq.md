## ArcaSwap

#### Why use ArcaSwap instead of another exchange ?

Currently, there are many decentralized exchanges that were modeled originally from Uniswap V2. They are proven to be excellent models for swapping most of cryptocurrencies. However, they are not so great with the stablecoins or other value-pegged assets swapping. This is because of the slippage that occurs during the tokens being swaps.

Stable pool nowadays still be ongoing with the large amount of transactions on this traditional model, causing the two stablecoins may be taken off peg. With this ArcaSwap the risk is mostly mitigated, our platform allow stablecoins to be relatively closer to their $1 peg, closer to $0.99 and $1.01 respectively.

#### Swap fees

ArcaSwap liquidity pools charge a 0.01% fee per swap which 80% of those fees are shared amongst the pool's liquidity providers and 20% of the fees as an admin fee for the protocol. Swap fees is considered to offer the most competitive swap and encourages arbitrage opportunity.

#### **Is swapping and providing liquidity on ArcaSwap pools safe?**

ArcaSwap originated as a fork of Saddle Finance which has been [audited ](https://docs.saddle.finance/smart-contract-audit)by Certik, Quantstamp, and OpenZeppelin. Saddle have passed security auditing on all Saddle smart contracts. Their audited can be found [here](general-faq.md#safety).

The ArcaSwap contract has not been audited yet. However, the deployed ArcaSwap contract all  contains bytecode that is identical to the Saddle Finance Swap contract ensuring that the deployed contract source code is safely forked and unmodified from the origin.
