# Audits

## Smart Contract Audits

Axial originated as a fork of Saddle Finance, which has been thoroughly audited. Their audits can be found [**here**](https://docs.saddle.finance/smart-contract-audit). The Axial exchange itself has not been individually audited yet.&#x20;

The contract bytecode of Saddle and Arca swap module are exactly the same. However, audits will eventually be proceeded according to the roadmap.
