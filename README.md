# Introduction

Arcaprotocol.fi is a decentralized ecosystem of [DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) products and protocols. Arcaprotocol.io platform is currently live on **Aurora**.

Our first product ArcaSwap is a stable AMM protocol that enables cheap, efficient, swift, and low-slippage swaps for traders and high-yield pools for LPs. More products are coming in the near future.

## Key Features

* **Same-value Assets Trading with near zero fee/slippage** - Swap between [_**stablecoins**_](broken-reference) alongside other bridged, wrapped or synthetic assets/derivatives on Arca, with significantly reduced fees compared to traditional DEXs.
* **Providing Liquidity & Mining Incentives with ultra low IL** - Provide [_**liquidity**_](broken-reference) to the protocol and earn risk-averse returns through others utilizing your liquidity to perform trades, as well as AXIAL token incentives.
* **arUSD Morphing** - allow users to morph nUSD and USDC and have them converted into arUSD at hard pegged 1:1 guaranteeing the stability in value.
* **and more to come** - Flash-loan, Borrowing, etc. More details in Roadmap.

## Liquidity Pools

The protocol initially supports swaps between arUSD, USDC & USDT (the Ellipsis 3pool). More pairs will be added in the near future.

Depositing liquidity into a [_**liquidity pool**_](broken-reference) nets you swap fees - but to earn extra rewards on top of that you should then deposit your LP tokens into one of our farms!

## Providing Liquidity

Providing liquidity on Axial will net you the transaction fees from users trading in any given pool, in addition to any AXIAL token incentives allocated to that pool. Here are some aspects of providing liquidity on Axial to keep in mind:

* **You may deposit or withdraw any combination of tokens you'd like.** This means that in a pool of 4 tokens, you can deposit all 4 in equal amounts, or just 1 at any time.
* **Depositing or withdrawing a token that helps balance the pool gives you a discount.** The opposite is true for transactions that further imbalance the pool.
