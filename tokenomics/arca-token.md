### **GOVERNANCE** <a href="#_toc87947035" id="_toc87947035"></a>

SDL token holders can vote on proposals. Initially, the proposals will be on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org), which the current [community multisig](https://docs.saddle.finance/saddle-faq#who-controls-saddles-admin-keys) will then enact. [Discourse](https://www.saddle.community) will be the platform for discussion of the proposals.

We expect proposals in the next few months to migrate to fully on-chain governance using the [Compound Governor Bravo](https://compound.finance) and add additional token economics.
